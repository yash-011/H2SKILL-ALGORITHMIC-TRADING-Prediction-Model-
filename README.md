project goes with:
1.Data Collection
2.Fundamental Analysis
3.Fake News Detection
4.APIS
5.Algorithm Building
6.Performance Evaluation and Iteration

Data Collection: Gather comprehensive data from diverse sources to inform the predictive models.Real-time news articles related to financial markets are collected from various credible sources. Stock Price with Historical and current stock price data is gathered, capturing daily, hourly, or even minute-by-minute fluctuations .Key financial metrics and ratios (e.g., earnings per share, P/E ratio, debt-to-equity ratio) of individual stocks are obtained to assess their financial health.

Fake News Detection: Filter out unreliable or fake news that could mislead the predictive models and investment decisions, Implement machine learning algorithms that specialize in natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis, Utilize features such as sentiment analysis, credibility scoring based on the source, and fact-checking algorithms to identify and remove fake or misleading news. Evaluate the sentiment of news articles to gauge their potential impact on specific stocks. Use sentiment analysis algorithms to classify the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of news articles, Determine whether news sentiment is likely to influence the market positively or negatively.

Fundamental Analysis: Analyze fundamental data to understand the intrinsic value and financial stability of stocks, Evaluate financial ratios, historical performance metrics, industry benchmarks, and qualitative assessments (e.g., management quality, competitive positioning)., Incorporate fundamental analysis insights into the predictive models to enrich decision-making.

Model name and info:


Predictive Modeling: Generate predictions on future stock price movements based on integrated inputs, Provide probabilistic forecasts or directional predictions (e.g., up, down, neutral) for stock prices over various time horizons, Present predictions through charts, graphs, or dashboards for clear interpretation by institutional investors.

Performance Evaluation and Iteration: Assess the accuracy and reliability of predictive models through rigorous evaluation, Measure model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and accuracy scores, Continuously refine models based on performance feedback and new data inputs, ensuring ongoing improvement.
